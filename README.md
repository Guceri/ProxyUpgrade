Topics Covered:
- Upgrading using Transparent Proxy pattern
- Use of OpenZeppelin plugins
- Designating Admin upgrade permissions
- Changing admin account
- Testing upgrades
- Understanding storage & function selector clashes

Cons:
>*However, the transparent pattern has a downside: gas cost. Each call requires an additional read from >storage to load the admin address, which became more expensive after the Istanbul fork last year. Furthermore, the contract itself is expensive to deploy compared to other proxies, at over 700k gas.*

## Instructions
1.  Create an initial smart contract (in this example it is Box.sol)
2.  We want to upgrade the contract (at some point in the future) so we use the following package for deployment:
```
'@openzeppelin/truffle-upgrades'
```
3.  We create a deployment script called "2_deploy_upgradeable_box.js".  
4.  We use the deployProxy() function to set our contract which is from the OpenZeppelin package
5.  Deployme
